    "question": "My washing machine won't spin. What can I do to fix it?",
    "answer": "If your washing machine is not spinning, it could be due to several reasons, such as a clogged drain hose, an unbalanced load, or a faulty lid switch. Here's how you can troubleshoot and potentially fix the issue:\n\n1. **Check for an unbalanced load**: Open the lid and redistribute the clothes evenly in the drum. Close the lid and start a spin cycle to see if it works.\n\n2. **Inspect the drain hose**: Make sure the drain hose is not clogged or kinked. Remove the hose from the back of the washer and check for blockages. Clean it if necessary.\n\n3. **Examine the lid switch**: If the lid switch is faulty, the washing machine won't spin. To test this, press the lid switch with a pen or screwdriver while the lid is open, then try to start a spin cycle. If it doesn't work, you may need to replace the lid switch.\n\n4. **Check the motor coupler**: If your washer is making a humming sound but not spinning, the motor coupler might be broken. This part connects the motor to the transmission. You will need to disassemble the washer to check it.\n\n5. **Inspect the belt**: If your washer has a belt-driven system, check if the belt is worn or broken. Replacing the belt may resolve the issue.\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the problem, it may be necessary to contact a professional for further diagnosis.",
